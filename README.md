# AmrTruckCheck

## Features

    * List of all active vehicles
    * Identify what vehicles need work
    * Form to document vehicle damage or not working component

## Technology

    * React front-end
    * Ruby on Rails back-end

## Problem

    I've been hearing that a lot of the time it is difficult for management to know when a vehicle has an issue due to lack of documentation. Maybe some don't know that forms at Operations or are just too lazy to do it.

## Solution

    Hopefully with an online form and real-time information what trucks have issue and what trucks don't, we can keep maintenance prompt and accurate.
